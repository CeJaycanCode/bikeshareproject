PYTHON SCRIPT THAT EXPLORES US BIKESHARE DATA

This python project is a part of Udacity's Nano Degree Program and designed to teach students practical uses for Python coding utilizing real-world data. After importing raw data as a csv document, an innovative and interactive project was created to present the raw statistics in a more aesthetic and readable form. 
The interactive program asks the user different questions and presents the data accordingly, taking into account user error, typos, and unavailable data using loops to circumvent various scenarios.



FUNCTIONS USED

The functions imported include time, pandas as pd, numpy as np, calendar, and datetime.
HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT
Running the script involved downloading anaconda and following the anaconda prompt from www.anaconda.com which in turn, installed Python 3. To double check my code I downloaded Visual Studio Code with the python extension to debug and run my python Script from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python

DATA SETS USED

These were all randomly selected data from Chicago, New York City and Washington from 2017. All of the data files contain the same columns: Start Time, End Time, Trip duration, Start Station, End station, User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
Chicago And New York City files have additional columns: Gender and Birth Year

QUESTIONS ASKED WITH INTERACTION

•	Most popular travel times, including the most common day of travel and the most popular hour of travel.
•	Most popular start and end station9s, and most frequent combinations of start and end stations
•	Trip durations, including the total and average travel times.
•	User information, including user types, counts of specific genders (only available for New York City and Chicago)
•	Earliest and most common year of birth (available for New York City and Chicago.
